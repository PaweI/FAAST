####Week 1 Challenge at Makers Academy!

#####Synopsis

Implement FAAST System (Fast And Accessible Super Tube).

**The FAAST system will cater for the following:**

  • There will be a number of trains inside the system.
  • Trains will travel from station to station.
  • Inside of a station, when the train stops, passengers will alight and enter the 
    carriages of the train.
  • A Passenger will touch in at the station and touch out at the destination station.
  • Each coach of a train can hold up to 40 passengers.
  • Each train is made of a number of coaches.
  • BONUS - add a charging system where the passengers can only touch in a station (and 
    access the train) if their account has more than 2 GBP.

#####My approach
As its stands for good projects to be started, first thing needs to be done is to understand what the problem actually is. I consider some nouns and verbs, which stands after for responsibilities, classes and collaborators. The Classes I decided relevant is **Passenger, Train, Station, Coach.** In the end I did small refactoring and implemented **TubeContainer**module.
